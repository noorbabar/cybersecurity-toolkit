            <h1>Defense in Depth</h1>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What is Defense in Depth?</h2>
                <p>Defense in Depth is like having multiple locks on your front door instead of just one. It means setting up several different security measures so that if one fails, others are still protecting your business.</p>
                <p>Think of it as layers of protection. Even if a cyber criminal gets past your first defense, they still have to break through several more before they can cause real damage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>The AAA Framework in Defense Layers</h2>
                <p>Each layer of defense should include the three key security controls:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Who are you? Every layer should verify identity before allowing access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authorisation:</strong> What can you do? Each system should check permissions independently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accounting:</strong> What did you do? Every layer should keep logs of activity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This way, even if someone bypasses one layer, they still face the same security checks at the next level.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Essential Defense Layers for Small Business</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> Firewall and secure WiFi to control what gets into your network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Endpoint Protection:</strong> Antivirus and security software on all computers and phones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Email Security:</strong> Spam filters and phishing protection to stop malicious emails.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Encryption and secure backups to protect your information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Strong passwords and multi factor authentication on all accounts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Staff Training:</strong> Regular education so your team can spot and avoid threats.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Building Your Defense Stack</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Network Layer:</strong> Log into your router's admin panel (usually 192.168.1.1), enable the built-in firewall, change default passwords, and set up a separate guest WiFi network with different credentials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Endpoint Layer:</strong> Install business-grade antivirus like Bitdefender GravityZone or Microsoft Defender for Business on every computer, phone, and tablet that connects to your business network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Email Layer:</strong> Contact your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) to enable Advanced Threat Protection or similar email security features that scan attachments and links.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Layer:</strong> See our <a href="iam.html">Identity & Access Management guide</a> for detailed MFA setup and  <a href="password-security.html"> password policies.</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Data Layer:</strong> Use built-in encryption tools like BitLocker (Windows) or FileVault (Mac) to encrypt your hard drives, and store backups using our <a href="backup-recovery.html">Backup & Recovery guide</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Layer:</strong> Follow our <a href="employee-training.html">Employee Training guide</a> to teach your team how to recognise threats.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Real World Example: When One Layer Fails</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Case:</strong> A Sydney accounting firm received a convincing phishing email that bypassed their email filters. One staff member clicked the link and entered their password.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> The attacker gained access to the email account but could not access client files because of multi factor authentication and network segmentation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> The business only lost access to one email account for a few hours instead of facing a complete data breach.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Multiple security layers meant that when one failed, others kept the business safe.</p>
