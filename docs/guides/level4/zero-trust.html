            <h1>Zero Trust Security</h1>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What is Zero Trust Security?</h2>
                <p>Zero Trust is a security approach that assumes no one and nothing can be trusted automatically, even if they're inside your network. Every user, device, and application must prove they are legitimate before accessing anything.</p>
                <p>Instead of building a wall around your business and trusting everything inside, Zero Trust checks every request every time. It's like having a security guard who asks for ID even if they recognize you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>The Zero Trust Principles</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Never trust, always verify:</strong> Check every user and device before granting access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assume breach:</strong> Plan as if attackers are already inside your network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Least privilege access:</strong> Give people only what they need to do their job.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verify explicitly:</strong> Use multiple sources of information to confirm identity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous monitoring:</strong> Keep watching for suspicious behavior even after granting access.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Zero Trust Components for Small Business</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identity verification:</strong> Multi factor authentication for all users and strong password policies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device security:</strong> Ensure all devices connecting to your network are secure and managed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network segmentation:</strong> Separate different parts of your network to limit damage if one part is compromised.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application security:</strong> Protect individual applications with their own security controls.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data protection:</strong> Encrypt sensitive data wherever it lives and control who can access it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitoring and analytics:</strong> Watch for unusual activity and respond quickly to threats.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Implementing Zero Trust on a Budget</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start with identity:</strong> Follow our <a href="identity-access-management.html">Identity & Access Management guide</a> to implement MFA across all business applications systematically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leverage cloud security:</strong> If using Office 365 or Google Workspace, enable Conditional Access policies that require additional verification for logins from new locations or devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Segment your network:</strong> Log into your business router and create VLANs to separate staff devices, guest WiFi, and critical servers. Most business routers have VLAN setup wizards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control privileged access:</strong> Use Windows built-in User Account Control (UAC) and require administrator approval for system changes. Never run daily operations from administrator accounts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitor user behavior:</strong> Enable login monitoring in your email and cloud applications. Office 365 and Google Workspace both provide free unusual activity alerts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular access reviews:</strong> Schedule quarterly reviews to check who has access to what systems and remove permissions that are no longer needed.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Real World Example: Zero Trust Prevents Insider Threat</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Case:</strong> A Melbourne consulting firm implemented Zero Trust after a contractor accidentally downloaded malware to their laptop.</p>
                    <p><strong>Protection:</strong> The Zero Trust system required re authentication when the infected laptop tried to access sensitive client files.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> The malware was contained to just the laptop because the system didn't trust the device's new behavior patterns.</p>
                    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> No client data was compromised and the incident was resolved within hours instead of days.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Zero Trust vs Traditional Security</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Traditional:</strong> Trust devices inside the network, focus on perimeter defense.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zero Trust:</strong> Trust nothing, verify everything regardless of location.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traditional:</strong> Once inside, users have broad access to resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zero Trust:</strong> Access is granted on a need to know basis for each resource.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traditional:</strong> Security focused on keeping threats out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zero Trust:</strong> Security assumes threats are already inside and limits their movement.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Simple Steps to Start Today</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ See our <a href="identity-access-management.html">Identity & Access Management guide</a> for step-by-step MFA setup on all business accounts</li>
                    <li>☐ Create separate user accounts for daily work and keep administrator accounts only for system maintenance</li>
                    <li>☐ Log into your router's admin panel and set up separate network segments for staff, guests, and servers</li>
                    <li>☐ Enable login location alerts in your Office 365 or Google Workspace admin console</li>
                    <li>☐ Schedule quarterly calendar reminders to review user permissions and remove unnecessary access</li>
                    <li>☐ Turn on Windows UAC or Mac's administrator password requirements for system changes</li>
                    <li>☐ Install endpoint detection software like Microsoft Defender for Business on all company devices</li>
                </ul>
