                <h2>What This Is About</h2>
                <p>Frameworks and compliance are structured approaches to cybersecurity that help you organise your security efforts and meet legal requirements. Think of them as proven blueprints that tell you exactly what to do and in what order.</p>
                <p>These frameworks help small businesses build professional grade security without guessing what's important or wasting money on unnecessary tools.</p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>What happened:</strong> A Melbourne accounting firm with 25 employees was struggling with multiple security issues - weak passwords, no backup procedures, and untrained staff clicking malicious links.</p>
                    <p><strong>What they did:</strong> They implemented the NIST framework systematically over 6 months, starting with asset inventory and moving through each function.</p>
                    <p><strong>The results:</strong> Within a year, they had zero successful phishing attacks, recovered from a ransomware attempt in 2 hours using their backups, and passed their professional liability insurance cybersecurity audit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Following a structured framework was more effective than randomly implementing security tools.</p>
