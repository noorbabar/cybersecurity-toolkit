            <div class="section">
                <h2>What is Incident Response?</h2>
                <p>Incident Response is your action plan for when something goes wrong with your computer systems or data. It helps you handle security problems quickly and get back to business faster.</p>
                <p>Having a plan ready means you won't waste time figuring out what to do during a crisis. You'll know exactly who to call and what steps to take.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>The Five Phases of Incident Response</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Get ready before anything happens by creating your plan and gathering contact details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Spot when something suspicious is happening and confirm it's a real security incident.</li>
                    <li><strong>Containment:</strong> Stop the problem from spreading to other systems or getting worse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eradication:</strong> Remove the threat completely from your systems and fix any damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Get everything back to normal and put extra monitoring in place.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Building Your Incident Response Plan</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Create your contact sheet:</strong> Write down phone numbers for your IT support company, cyber insurance provider (if you have one), main bank, key suppliers, and your three most important customers. Keep this printed and in your desk drawer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Define roles clearly:</strong> Write down who makes the final decisions (usually the business owner), who talks to customers, who handles the technical response, and who deals with media or authorities if needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document your critical systems:</strong> Make a simple one-page list of your most important systems (accounting software, customer database, email server) and include instructions on how to safely shut them down if needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Understand your insurance:</strong> Call your insurance broker to confirm if you have cyber liability coverage, what it covers, and the exact process to make a claim.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice annually:</strong> Once a year, spend 30 minutes walking through a simple scenario like "what if our email goes down" to test if everyone knows their role.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it accessible:</strong> Write the plan in simple bullet points and store copies both digitally and printed, so you can access it even if your computers are down.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Real World Example: Quick Response Saves Business</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Case:</strong> A Brisbane marketing agency noticed their computers running slowly and strange files appearing on their server.</p>
                    <p><strong>Response:</strong> They immediately disconnected from the internet, called their IT support, and switched to backup systems they had prepared.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> They contained the ransomware attack within two hours and restored operations from backups the same day.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key:</strong> Having a plan and acting quickly prevented a minor incident from becoming a business disaster.</p>
