            <div class="section">
                <h2>What is Vulnerability Management?</h2>
                <p>Vulnerability Management means finding and fixing security weaknesses in your systems before cyber criminals can exploit them. It's like regularly checking your doors and windows to make sure they're still secure.</p>
                <p>Most cyber attacks succeed because they target known weaknesses that haven't been patched yet. By staying on top of these issues, you can close these gaps before they become problems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Common Vulnerabilities in Small Business</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Outdated software:</strong> Old versions of programs that have known security flaws.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weak passwords:</strong> Easy to guess passwords that give attackers quick access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unpatched systems:</strong> Operating systems missing important security updates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Misconfigured services:</strong> Systems set up incorrectly that expose sensitive data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unnecessary services:</strong> Programs running that you don't need but create security risks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insecure remote access:</strong> Ways to connect from outside that aren't properly protected.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>The Vulnerability Management Process</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Discover:</strong> Find all the devices, software, and services in your business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assess:</strong> Check these systems for known security weaknesses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritize:</strong> Focus on the most dangerous problems first.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remediate:</strong> Fix the vulnerabilities by applying patches or changing settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Check that your fixes actually worked.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Do this regularly because new vulnerabilities are found all the time.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Simple Vulnerability Management for Small Business</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Set up automatic updates:</strong> Go to Windows Update settings and enable "Download and install updates automatically" or on Mac, enable "Install system data files and security updates" in Software Update preferences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use built-in patch management:</strong> For Windows, use Windows Update for Business (free) or for multiple computers, use Microsoft WSUS. For Mac environments, use Apple Remote Desktop or a service like Jamf Now.</li>
                    <li><strong>Schedule regular security scans:</strong> Download free tools like Nessus Essentials or use online scanners like Qualys VMDR Express to check your external-facing systems monthly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintain a software inventory:</strong> Create a simple spreadsheet listing every piece of software you use, version numbers, and last update dates. Update this quarterly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Audit and remove unused software:</strong> Go through Programs and Features (Windows) or Applications folder (Mac) and uninstall anything you haven't used in 6 months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subscribe to security bulletins:</strong> Sign up for email alerts from Microsoft Security Response Center, Adobe Security Bulletins, and other vendors whose software you use.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Real World Example: Unpatched Systems Under Attack</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Case:</strong> A Perth law firm delayed updating their server software because they were worried about downtime during a busy period.</p>
                    <p><strong>Attack:</strong> Criminals used a three month old vulnerability to break into their system and steal client files.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> The firm faced regulatory fines, lost clients, and spent over one hundred thousand dollars on incident response and legal fees.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> The patch was available months before the attack but wasn't applied because there was no process for regular updates.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Priority Fixes for Maximum Impact</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Critical security patches:</strong> Updates marked as urgent by software vendors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internet facing systems:</strong> Anything accessible from outside your network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Administrative accounts:</strong> Systems with elevated privileges that could cause major damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer data systems:</strong> Databases or applications that store sensitive information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial systems:</strong> Accounting software and payment processing tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backup systems:</strong> Ensure your safety nets are secure too.</li>
