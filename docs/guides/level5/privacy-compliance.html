                <h2>What is Privacy Compliance?</h2>
                <p>Privacy Compliance means following laws that protect people's personal information. These laws tell you how to collect, store, use, and share customer data responsibly and legally.</p>
                <p>Getting privacy wrong can result in hefty fines, legal troubles, and loss of customer trust. But done right, it becomes a competitive advantage that shows customers you take their privacy seriously.</p>
