                <h2>What are CIS Controls?</h2>
                <p>The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls are a prioritised set of actions that provide specific and actionable ways to stop today's most dangerous attacks. Think of them as a cybersecurity to-do list ranked by what will protect you most.</p>
                <p>Instead of trying to do everything at once, CIS Controls tell you which security measures to implement first for maximum protection with limited resources.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>The Three Implementation Groups</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Implementation Group 1 (IG1):</strong> For small businesses with limited cybersecurity expertise. Focuses on basic cyber hygiene with simple, low cost solutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implementation Group 2 (IG2):</strong> For businesses with some IT resources. Adds more sophisticated security measures and monitoring capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implementation Group 3 (IG3):</strong> For organisations with dedicated cybersecurity staff. Includes advanced threat hunting and specialised security tools.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most small businesses should focus on IG1 first, then gradually move toward IG2 as their security maturity and resources grow.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>CIS Critical Security Controls (Top 6 for Small Business)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CIS Control 1 - Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets:</strong> Make a list of every computer, phone, tablet, and server in your business. Use tools like Lansweeper (free for 100 assets) or simply create an Excel spreadsheet.</li>
                    <li><strong>CIS Control 2 - Inventory and Control of Software Assets:</strong> Document all installed software and remove programs you don't need. Use Windows "Programs and Features" or Mac "Applications" folder to audit monthly.</li>
                    <li><strong>CIS Control 3 - Data Protection:</strong> Identify where your sensitive data lives and encrypt it. Enable BitLocker on Windows or FileVault on Mac for all business computers.</li>
                    <li><strong>CIS Control 4 - Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software:</strong> Change default passwords, disable unnecessary services, and use security benchmarks. Download CIS Benchmarks for free from the CIS website.</li>
                    <li><strong>CIS Control 5 - Account Management:</strong> See our <a href="../level3/iam.html">Identity & Access Management guide</a> for detailed user account control procedures.</li>
                    <li><strong>CIS Control 6 - Access Control Management:</strong> Limit who can access what data and systems. Use Windows Active Directory or Google Workspace admin controls to set permissions.</li>
