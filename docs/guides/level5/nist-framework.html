            <h1>NIST Cybersecurity Framework</h1>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework?</h2>
                <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework is a set of guidelines for managing cybersecurity risk. It provides a common language for understanding, managing, and reducing cybersecurity risk across your business.</p>
                <p>Think of it as a roadmap that helps you organise your cybersecurity efforts into five key areas, making it easier to see what you have, what you need, and where to focus your limited time and money.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>The Five Core Functions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identify:</strong> Know what you have and what needs protection. This includes your data, systems, people, and business processes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Protect:</strong> Put safeguards in place to limit the impact of cybersecurity events. This includes access controls, training, and data security.</li>
                    <li><strong>Detect:</strong> Find cybersecurity events when they happen. This includes monitoring systems and user activity for signs of problems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respond:</strong> Take action when a cybersecurity incident is detected. This includes having an incident response plan and communication procedures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recover:</strong> Get back to normal operations after an incident. This includes restoring systems and improving based on lessons learned.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>NIST Implementation for Small Business</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identify Phase:</strong> Create simple inventories of your assets, data, and business processes. Use spreadsheets to list what computers you have, what data you store, and which processes are critical to your business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Protect Phase:</strong> Implement basic security controls like firewalls, antivirus, and user training. Follow our guides on <a href="../level3/iam.html">access management</a> and <a href="../level2/employee-training.html">employee training</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Detect Phase:</strong> Enable logging on your systems and set up alerts for suspicious activity. Most business software includes basic monitoring features you can turn on.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respond Phase:</strong> Create a simple incident response plan using our <a href="../level4/incident-response.html">Incident Response guide</a> and practice it annually.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recover Phase:</strong> Set up regular backups using our <a href="../level3/backup-recovery.html">Backup & Recovery guide</a> and document how to restore your critical systems.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>NIST Framework Implementation Tiers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tier 1 - Partial:</strong> Cybersecurity risk management is ad hoc with limited awareness. Most small businesses start here.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 2 - Risk Informed:</strong> Risk management practices are approved by management but may not be established as organisation wide policy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 3 - Repeatable:</strong> Organisation's cybersecurity risk management practices are formally approved and expressed as policy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 4 - Adaptive:</strong> Organisation adapts its cybersecurity practices based on lessons learned and predictive indicators.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Small businesses should aim to reach Tier 2 within their first year of focused cybersecurity effort.</p>
