            <h1>Risk Assessment</h1>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What is a Risk Assessment?</h2>
                <p>A Risk Assessment helps you identify what could go wrong with your business's cybersecurity and how badly it could hurt you. It's like doing a security inspection of your business to find the weak spots before criminals do.</p>
                <p>By understanding your biggest risks, you can focus your limited time and money on protecting what matters most to your business.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Types of Risk Assessment</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Qualitative Risk Assessment:</strong> Uses descriptive terms like "high," "medium," and "low" to rate risks. Easier for small businesses without complex data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quantitative Risk Assessment:</strong> Uses numbers and calculations to estimate financial impact. More precise but requires detailed data most small businesses don't have.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Risk Assessment:</strong> Combines both approaches. Uses numbers where available and descriptive terms elsewhere.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most small businesses should start with a qualitative assessment and add quantitative elements as they gather more data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Risk Assessment Process</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Asset Identification:</strong> List everything valuable in your business including data, systems, and processes. Use our asset inventory template to get started.</li>
                    <li><strong>Threat Identification:</strong> Identify what could attack or damage your assets. Common threats include ransomware, phishing, insider threats, and natural disasters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vulnerability Assessment:</strong> Find weaknesses that threats could exploit. Check for unpatched software, weak passwords, and missing security controls.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact Analysis:</strong> Determine how much damage each successful attack could cause. Consider financial loss, operational disruption, and reputation damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Likelihood Assessment:</strong> Estimate how likely each threat is to succeed. Base this on industry data and your current security posture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Calculation:</strong> Combine impact and likelihood to determine overall risk level for each scenario.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Simple Risk Rating System</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Impact Levels:</strong> Low (minimal business disruption), Medium (some disruption but manageable), High (significant disruption or major financial loss)</li>
                    <li><strong>Likelihood Levels:</strong> Low (unlikely to happen), Medium (could happen), High (likely to happen)</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Levels:</strong> Critical (High Impact + High Likelihood), High (High Impact + Medium Likelihood OR Medium Impact + High Likelihood), Medium (Medium Impact + Medium Likelihood), Low (Low Impact regardless of likelihood)</li>
                    <li><strong>Priority Actions:</strong> Critical risks need immediate action, High risks need action within 30 days, Medium risks within 90 days, Low risks when resources allow</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
