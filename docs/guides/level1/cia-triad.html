            <h1>The CIA Triad</h1>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What Is the CIA Triad?</h2>
                <p>The CIA Triad is a simple way to think about the three things every business must protect when it comes to digital systems and data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Keeping sensitive information private</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrity</strong>:Keeping your information correct and unchanged</li>
                    <li><strong>Availability</strong>:Making sure your systems and data are always accessible when needed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This applies whether you run a clinic, café, online store, accounting firm, creative agency, or any other small business.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Let’s Break It Down</h2>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Only the right people should have access to sensitive business information. That includes things like customer data, pricing, HR files, or financial reports.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> If someone outside your business can open your invoices, payroll files, or staff records, that's a confidentiality issue.</p>
                    <p><strong>Quick Fixes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✓ Set passwords on documents and devices</li>
                        <li>✓ Don’t share private info over email or text</li>
                        <li>✓ Use secure apps (like Google Drive or Microsoft 365) for private files</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Integrity</h4>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Your data should be accurate and trustworthy. No one should be able to change it without permission, whether by accident or on purpose.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> If someone changes prices on your website or deletes your booking list, and you didn’t approve it, that’s an integrity problem.</p>
                    <p><strong>Quick Fixes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✓ Limit editing access to trusted staff only</li>
                        <li>✓ Use tools that track changes (e.g. version history in Google Docs)</li>
                        <li>✓ Back up important data weekly</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Availability</h4>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Your systems and services should be up and running when you (or your customers) need them. This includes your website, email, booking system, or POS.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> If your online store crashes on a sale day, or your team can’t access client files during the day, that’s an availability issue.</p>
                    <p><strong>Quick Fixes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✓ Back up files in the cloud or on an external drive</li>
                        <li>✓ Use tools that send alerts when systems go down</li>
                        <li>✓ Have a simple offline plan for emergencies (e.g. paper bookings)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Real-World Failure Example</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Availability Failure:</strong> A Sydney-based wedding photographer lost years of client photos after a hard drive crash. The files weren’t backed up, and recovery was impossible,leading to lost income and upset clients.</p>
                    <p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.ontrack.com/en-au/case-studies/ontrack-saved-my-data-after-a-hard-drive-head-crash" target="_blank">Data Recovery Case Study</a></p>
                    <p><strong>Simple Fix:</strong> They now use cloud storage and an external backup drive to ensure every photo is saved in two places. Setup took under 20 minutes and cost less than $100.</p>

            <div class="action-items">
                <h3>Quick Self-Check</h3>
                <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ Is private data in my business only seen by the right people?</li>
                    <li>☐ Could someone change or delete files without me knowing?</li>
                    <li>☐ Do I have a backup if a device or system stops working?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you’re unsure, start with one fix from each list above. Most take under 10 minutes.</p>
