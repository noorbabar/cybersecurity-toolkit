            <h1>Understanding Cyber Risk</h1>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>Before you can protect your business, you need to understand what you're protecting it from. Cyber risk isn't just about technology - it's about understanding how threats could impact your business and making informed decisions about where to invest your limited time and resources.</p>
                <p>Small businesses are targeted 43% more than large companies because criminals know you likely have fewer resources to defend yourself. But understanding risk gives you the power to make smart security decisions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-formula">
                <h3>The Risk Formula</h3>
                <div class="formula">Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact</div>
                <p>This simple formula helps you evaluate any security decision. High risk areas need immediate attention, while low risk areas can wait.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Breaking Down the Formula</h2>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Threat</h4>
                    <p><strong>What could go wrong?</strong> Common threats include ransomware, phishing emails, data breaches, system failures, or disgruntled employees. The likelihood varies by industry and business size.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Vulnerability</h4>
                    <p><strong>What weaknesses exist?</strong> Outdated software, weak passwords, lack of backups, untrained staff, or poor physical security. These are gaps that threats can exploit.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Impact</h4>
                    <p><strong>What would happen if this threat exploited this vulnerability?</strong> Consider financial loss, business downtime, reputation damage, legal consequences, and recovery costs.</p>

                    <h4>Scenario: Ransomware Attack</h4>
                    <p><strong>Threat:</strong> Ransomware gangs targeting small businesses (High - happening daily)</p>
                    <p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> Staff clicking phishing links + no backup system (High - very common)</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Business shut down for weeks, $50,000 ransom demand, customer data lost (Very High)</p>
                    <p><strong>Risk Level:</strong> CRITICAL - Needs immediate action</p>

                <h3>Your First Risk Assessment</h3>
                <p>Ask yourself these questions about your business:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✓ What would happen if our computers were locked by ransomware tomorrow?</li>
                    <li>✓ How would we operate if our main systems were down for a week?</li>
                    <li>✓ What's our most valuable data, and where is it stored?</li>
                    <li>✓ Who has access to our critical systems and data?</li>
                    <li>✓ When did we last update our software and systems?</li>
                    <li>✓ Have we ever tested our backup and recovery procedures?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common High-Risk Areas for Small Business</h2>
                <p>Based on thousands of incidents, these areas typically represent the highest risk for small businesses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Email-based attacks</strong> - 94% of malware arrives via email</li>
                    <li><strong>Weak or reused passwords</strong> - 80% of breaches involve weak credentials</li>
                    <li><strong>Unpatched software</strong> - Criminals exploit known vulnerabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of backups</strong> - No way to recover from ransomware or hardware failure</li>
                    <li><strong>Untrained staff</strong> - Humans are often the weakest link</li>
                </ul>
