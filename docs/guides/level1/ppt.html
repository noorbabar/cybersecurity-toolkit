                <h2>Easy Rules to Keep Your Data and Systems Safe</h2>
                <p>Your business needs simple, practical steps to protect what matters, your data, your people, and your technology. These steps don’t require you to be an expert, and you can start today.</p>

                <h2>Process: Set Clear Rules for Access and Backups</h2>
                <p>Write down what data and systems are important, and decide exactly who can see or use each one. Limit access only to people who truly need it.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make a simple list of important info and who should access it (customer data, payments, pricing, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Set a regular backup schedule (at least once a week) to save copies of your files. Use USB drives or free cloud storage like Google Drive.</li>
                    <li>Write a basic plan for what to do if something goes wrong, like a virus or data loss, include who to call for help.</li>
                    <li>Review and update these rules every six months.</li>

                <h2>People: Train Your Team and Control Access</h2>
                <p>Your staff need to know what to watch for and how to protect your business.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Teach everyone to spot suspicious emails and not to click links or download attachments unless sure.</li>
                    <li>Use strong, different passwords for each account, consider using a free password manager app like LastPass or Bitwarden.</li>
                    <li>Only give staff access to what they need for their job.</li>
                    <li>When staff leave, immediately change all passwords they used and remove their system access.</li>
                    <li>Create a culture where people can ask questions and report anything suspicious without fear.</li>

                <p>Use your devices and software as a tool to protect your business, not as a risk.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>When your computer or apps ask to install updates, say “yes”, updates fix security holes.</li>
                    <li>Install antivirus software (there are free options) and run scans regularly.</li>
                    <li>Back up important files regularly, at least once a week.</li>
                    <li>Use two-factor authentication (2FA) on your important accounts, this means logging in with a password plus a code sent to your phone.</li>
                    <li>Secure your Wi-Fi network with a strong password and don’t share it widely.</li>

                <h2>Real-World Example: What Happens Without These Steps</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Case:</strong> In 2025, Ambulance Victoria suffered a data breach where a former employee still had system access after leaving and transferred sensitive staff data, including personal and financial details.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This breach exposed thousands of employees' private information, risking identity theft and financial fraud, and triggered investigations by police authorities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Ambulance Victoria reviewed and strengthened their access controls, immediately revoked access for departing staff, and improved security procedures to prevent future incidents.</p>

                <h3>Quick Self-Check</h3>
                <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ Do I know who can access my important data and have I limited that access?</li>
                    <li>☐ Has my team been trained on spotting cyber threats like phishing?</li>
                    <li>☐ Are all devices updated and backed up regularly?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If not, start with one action from each step above. Small changes make a big difference.</p>
