            <div class="section">
                <h2>What Are Admin Privileges?</h2>
                <p>Admin privileges are special permissions that let someone control the computers and systems in your business. With admin rights, a person can install or delete software, change settings, and access all your data.</p>
                <p>Because of this power, if a cyber criminal gets hold of an admin account, they can do a lot of damage very quickly, like stealing customer info, locking you out, or installing harmful software.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Why Should You Limit Admin Access?</h2>
                <p>Not everyone in your business needs admin rights. Giving these permissions to too many people increases the risk that a mistake or a cyber attack could cause serious problems.</p>
                <p>Keeping admin access limited helps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce chances of cyber criminals taking control</li>
                    <li>Prevent accidental changes that might break your systems</li>
                    <li>Make it easier to spot suspicious activity</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>How to Control Admin Privileges</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Find Out Who Has Admin Access</h3>
                <p>Ask your IT person, or if you don’t have one, check the user accounts on your computers and systems.</p>
                <p>On Windows, go to <em>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family & other users</em> or <em>Control Panel &gt; User Accounts</em> to see who has admin rights.</p>
                <p>On Mac, go to <em>System Preferences &gt; Users & Groups</em> and look for accounts marked “Admin.”</p>

                <h3>2. Remove Admin Access from People Who Don’t Need It</h3>
                <p>Only give admin access to people who really need it, usually just you or trusted tech helpers.</p>
                <p>Change other accounts to “standard user” so they can’t make big changes.</p>
                <p>If you don’t know how, look for online guides or ask a trusted expert to help.</p>

                <h3>3. Use Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Admin Accounts</h3>
                <p>Make sure admin accounts have strong, unique passwords that no one can guess.</p>
                <p>Turn on MFA — this means logging in requires something extra like a code sent to your phone, so even if a password is stolen, the account stays safe.</p>
                <p><a href="../level2/mfa-guide.html">See our MFA guide for help</a></p>

                <h3>4. Use Standard Accounts for Daily Work</h3>
                <p>Everyone else should use standard user accounts without admin rights for normal tasks like checking email or using software.</p>
                <p>This helps prevent accidental changes or malware from spreading if someone clicks a bad link.</p>

                <h3>5. Remove Admin Access Immediately When Someone Leaves or Changes Role</h3>
                <p>If a staff member or contractor leaves your business, immediately remove their admin and user access.</p>
                <p>This stops ex-employees from accessing your systems or data.</p>

                <h3>6. Monitor and Review Admin Account Use Regularly</h3>
                <p>Keep track of when admin accounts are used, and watch for anything unusual like logins at strange hours.</p>
                <p>If you don’t have a system for this, set a calendar reminder to review admin users and passwords every 3 months.</p>

                <h2>Real World Example: What Can Go Wrong</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Case:</strong> In 2021, JBS Australia, a major meat processor, was hit by ransomware because admin rights were too broadly given and not secured properly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> The ransomware shut down multiple facilities, causing millions in losses and disrupting supply chains.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fix:</strong> After the attack, JBS tightened admin controls by limiting access, enforcing MFA, and monitoring account activity.</p>

                <h2>Start Improving Your Admin Controls Today</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ Identify who currently has admin access on your computers and systems</li>
                    <li>☐ Remove admin rights from anyone who doesn’t need it</li>
                    <li>☐ Make sure admin accounts have strong passwords and MFA enabled</li>
                    <li>☐ Set everyone else to use standard user accounts for daily tasks</li>
                    <li>☐ Regularly check admin accounts and remove access immediately when people leave</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Taking these steps helps protect your business from hackers and accidental mistakes that could cause big problems.</p>
