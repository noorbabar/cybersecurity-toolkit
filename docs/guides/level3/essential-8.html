            <h1>Essential 8 Implementation</h1>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What is the Essential 8?</h2>
                <p>The Essential Eight is a list from the Australian Cyber Security Centre. It shows the eight key actions every business should take to stop cyber criminals and protect data from ransomware and theft.</p>
                <p>We’ve talked about some of these before like Multi Factor Authentication and patching. Here, you’ll see how all eight fit together to keep your business safe.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>The Eight Controls and How to Use Them</h2>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>1. Application Control</h4>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Only allow trusted apps and programs to run on your devices. Block everything else, especially unknown or unneeded software.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> On Windows, turn on AppLocker or Microsoft Defender Application Control. Or, set a rule that new software can only be installed after your approval.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>2. Patch Applications</h4>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Keep apps like browsers, PDF readers, and media players updated so cyber criminals can’t use old weaknesses to get in.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Turn on automatic updates or use tools like Ninite to update everything at once. <a href="../level2/patch.html">See full guide</a></p>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>3. Configure Microsoft Office Macro Settings</h4>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Macros are small scripts that can automate tasks in Office but can also spread malware.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Disable macros unless you really need them. In Microsoft 365, go to Trust Center, then Macro Settings, and choose “Disable all except digitally signed macros.”</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>4. User Application Hardening</h4>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Turn off risky app features like Flash or JavaScript in PDFs that cyber criminals use to attack.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Use modern browsers like Chrome or Edge with pop-up blockers. Disable or uninstall Flash and Java if you don’t need them.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>5. Restrict Administrative Privileges</h4>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Admin accounts have full control. If hackers get these, they can take over everything.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Only give admin rights to people who really need it. Remove admin rights when staff leave or no longer need them.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>6. Patch Operating Systems</h4>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Keep your computer and phone operating systems updated to close security holes.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Turn on automatic updates on all devices. <a href="../level2/patch.html">Learn more</a></p>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>7. Multi Factor Authentication</h4>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Require more than a password to log in, like a code sent to a phone or an app.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Turn on MFA for email, banking, websites, and any system with important data. <a href="../level2/mfa-guide.html">Step-by-step guide</a></p>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>8. Regular Backups</h4>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Keep copies of your important files so you can recover quickly if cyber criminals lock or delete your data.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Back up at least once a week. Use cloud services like Google Drive or Dropbox, or an external drive kept separately from your computers.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <h2>Real World Example When Controls Are Ignored</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Case:</strong> In May 2021 JBS Australia was hit by ransomware that shut down meat processing in Australia and North America.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Operations stopped, causing financial loss and major disruption.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fix:</strong> They improved patching, limited admin access, and started daily backups after the attack.</p>
