                    <p><strong>60% of small businesses close permanently within 6 months of a major data loss.</strong> Ransomware, fires, theft, or simple computer crashes can wipe out years of work in seconds. Solution: Automatic backups to 3 places. Cost: $20/month. Time to set up: 30 minutes.</p>

                    <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Sydney wedding photographer's laptop was stolen from car. Lost 3 years of client photos, contracts, and booking calendars. No backups.</p>
                    <p><strong>The damage:</strong> 40 couples lost their wedding photos forever. $127,000 in lawsuits. Business closed within 8 months.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention cost:</strong> $15/month cloud storage would have saved everything</p>

                <p>This simple rule protects everything:</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4> 3 Copies of Everything Important</h4>
                    <p><strong>Original:</strong> On your computer (working copy)</p>
                    <p><strong>Copy 1:</strong> Cloud storage (Google, Microsoft, Dropbox)</p>
                    <p><strong>Copy 2:</strong> External hard drive (kept at home or other location)</p>
                    <p><strong>Why 3?</strong> If ransomware hits your computer, cloud saves you. If cloud fails, external drive saves you. If your office burns down, offsite backup saves you.</p>

                    <p><strong>Monday:</strong> You work on customer database on computer</p>
                    <p><strong>Automatically:</strong> Changes sync to Google Drive in real-time</p>
                    <p><strong>Every night:</strong> Computer backs up to external drive</p>
                    <p><strong>Weekly:</strong> Take external drive home (or use second cloud service)</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Even if office explodes, your data is safe in 2 other places</p>
