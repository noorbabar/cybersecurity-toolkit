            <div class="section">
                <h2>Why Backup Your Data?</h2>
                <p>Backing up your data means making extra copies of your important files and information so you don’t lose everything if your computer crashes, gets stolen, or ransomware locks you out.</p>
                <p>It’s one of the simplest ways to protect your business and keep running even when things go wrong.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>How to Back Up Effectively</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Choose what to back up:</strong> Focus on critical data like customer info, financial records, and important documents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Back up regularly:</strong> Weekly backups are the minimum. For busy businesses, daily is best.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use multiple backup locations:</strong> Store backups both in the cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox) and on an external hard drive kept separate from your computer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test your backups:</strong> Occasionally check that you can restore files from your backup.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep backup software up to date:</strong> This ensures the process works smoothly and securely.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Example: When Backups Save the Day</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Case:</strong> In 2019 the City of Baltimore was hit by ransomware, locking many systems and stopping key services. Limited backups meant recovery took weeks and cost over $18 million.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Services were disrupted, payments delayed, and public trust was damaged.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Baltimore has since improved backup and recovery plans to prevent future disasters.</p>

                <h3>Start Backing Up This Week</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>☐ Set up automatic cloud backups</li>
                    <li>☐ Buy or use an external hard drive for extra backups</li>
                    <li>☐ Test restoring a file from your backup</li>
                </ul>
