            <div class="section">
                <h2>What is Identity and Access Management?</h2>
                <p>Identity and Access Management means controlling who can get into your business systems and data. It makes sure only the right people can see or change important information.</p>
                <p>This stops cyber criminals from sneaking in using stolen passwords or leftover accounts from people who no longer work with you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>The AAA of Access Management</h2>
                <p>To keep your business safe, focus on the three key parts of access control, known as <strong>AAA</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Confirming who someone is — usually by requiring a username and password, or better, adding a second step like a code sent to a phone (MFA).</li>
                    <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Deciding what that person is allowed to do. For example, a staff member might view customer info but not delete it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accounting:</strong> Keeping records of who accessed what and when — so you can check if anything suspicious happens.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using these three steps helps you control access carefully and spot problems early.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>How to Manage Identity and Access</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Review who has access:</strong> Make a list of everyone with accounts and what they can do.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remove old accounts:</strong> Delete or disable accounts for former staff, contractors, or temporary users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use strong passwords:</strong> Require passwords that are hard to guess, and change them regularly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Turn on Multi Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Require a second check like a code on a phone whenever someone logs in.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limit access:</strong> Give people only the access they need to do their job, not more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep logs:</strong> Where possible, track who logged in and what they did to help catch problems early.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Real World Example: When Access Is Not Managed</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Case:</strong> A small Australian healthcare provider was hit by ransomware after a staff computer without admin restrictions was compromised.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Systems were locked and patients turned away. The business shut down for five days and costs went over fifty thousand dollars.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fix:</strong> They now limit admin access to the owner, use automatic updates, and perform backups every night.</p>

                <h2>Simple Steps to Start Today</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ List all user accounts and their permissions</li>
                    <li>☐ Remove access for anyone who no longer needs it</li>
                    <li>☐ Require strong passwords and change them every 3 to 6 months</li>
                    <li>☐ Turn on Multi Factor Authentication for all important accounts</li>
                    <li>☐ Limit admin rights only to trusted people who really need it</li>
                    <li>☐ Where possible, enable logging to track user activity</li>
