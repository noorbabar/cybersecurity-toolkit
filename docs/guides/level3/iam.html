            <div class="section">
                <h2>What This Is About</h2>
                <p>Managing staff and access means controlling who can get into your business systems and training your team to spot cyber threats. Your employees are both your biggest security risk and your strongest defense, it all depends on how well you manage and train them.</p>
                <p>Most successful cyber attacks target employees rather than breaking through technical defenses, making staff management and training critical for small business security.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>The AAA Framework (Access Control Basics)</h2>
                <p>Every business needs to follow three key steps for controlling access to systems and data:</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Authentication - Who are you?</h4>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Confirming someone is who they claim to be before letting them in.</p>
                    <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Require strong passwords for all accounts</li>
                        <li>Use two-factor authentication, we'll cover this in detail: <a href="../level2/mfa-guide.html">read more here</a></li>
                        <li>Never share login credentials between people</li>
                        <li>Change passwords immediately when staff leave</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h4>Authorisation: What can you do?</h4>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Deciding what someone is allowed to access once they're logged in.</p>
                    <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Give people only the minimum access they need for their job</li>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Why limit admin access:</h4>
                    <p>Admin privileges let someone control everything on your computers and systems. If a cyber criminal gets admin access, they can steal all your data, install malware, or lock you out completely.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Find who has admin access:</strong> Check user accounts on all computers and systems</li>
                        <li><strong>Remove unnecessary admin rights:</strong> Only business owners and essential IT staff should have admin access</li>
                        <li><strong>Use standard accounts for daily work:</strong> Even admins should use regular accounts for email and normal tasks</li>
                        <li><strong>Secure admin accounts:</strong> Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor admin activity:</strong> Keep logs of when admin accounts are used and for what</li>
                        <li><strong>Remove access immediately:</strong> When someone leaves, remove their admin access the same day</li>

                        <li><strong>Review access quarterly:</strong> Check who has access to what every three months</li>
                        <li><strong>Document everything:</strong> Keep records of who has access to what and why</li>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>What happened:</strong> A Perth marketing agency discovered that a contractor was accessing client files outside their project scope, potentially to steal client lists for a competing business.</p>
                    <p><strong>How it was caught:</strong> The business had implemented access logging and noticed the contractor was logging in during weekends and accessing files unrelated to their assigned project.</p>
                    <p><strong>What they did:</strong> They immediately revoked the contractor's access, reviewed what files were accessed, and implemented stricter access controls with project specific permissions.</p>
                    <p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Proper access controls and monitoring caught the threat before any data was stolen or misused.</p>
