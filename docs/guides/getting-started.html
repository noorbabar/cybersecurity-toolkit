                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>Small businesses are targeted 43% more than large companies because they often have weaker security defenses. A single cyberattack can cost a small business an average of $200,000 and many never recover.</p>
                <p>The good news? Most attacks can be prevented with basic security measures that don't require technical expertise or huge budgets.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Essential 8 - Simplified</h2>
                <p>The Australian government's Essential 8 framework provides a blueprint for cybersecurity. Here's what it means for your business:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application Control</strong> - Only run trusted software</li>
                    <li><strong>Patch Applications</strong> - Keep software updated</li>
                    <li><strong>Configure Microsoft Office</strong> - Disable risky features</li>
                    <li><strong>User Application Hardening</strong> - Secure web browsers and email</li>
                    <li><strong>Restrict Admin Privileges</strong> - Limit who can install software</li>
                    <li><strong>Patch Operating Systems</strong> - Keep Windows/Mac updated</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-factor Authentication</strong> - Use 2FA everywhere</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Backups</strong> - Test and verify your backups work</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Building Your Security Culture</h2>
                <p>Technology alone isn't enough. Your team needs to understand their role in keeping the business secure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Train staff to recognise phishing emails</li>
                    <li>Establish clear policies for handling sensitive data</li>
                    <li>Create a culture where reporting suspicious activity is encouraged</li>
                    <li>Regularly discuss security in team meetings</li>
                </ul>
