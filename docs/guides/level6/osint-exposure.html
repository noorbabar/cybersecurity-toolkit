            <h1>OSINT Exposure</h1>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What is OSINT Exposure?</h2>
                <p>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Exposure refers to how much information about your business, employees, and systems is publicly available online. Cyber criminals use this freely available information to plan targeted attacks against your business.</p>
                <p>The more attackers know about your business, the more convincing and effective their attacks become. Reducing your OSINT footprint makes it harder for criminals to craft personalised scams and find vulnerabilities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Common Sources of Business OSINT</h2>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Employee personal accounts, company pages, photos of offices, equipment, and business relationships.</li>

            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>How Attackers Use OSINT Against Small Business</h2>

                    <li><strong>Physical Security:</strong> Use office photos and location information to plan physical break-ins or tailgating attacks.</li>
