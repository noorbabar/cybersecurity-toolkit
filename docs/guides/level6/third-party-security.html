            <h1>Third Party Security</h1>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What is Third Party Security?</h2>
                <p>Third Party Security means checking that companies you work with won't accidentally expose your business data or let hackers in through their systems.</p>
                <p>Think of it like this: if your accountant gets hacked, the criminals might access your financial data too. If your IT company gets breached, they could use their access to attack your systems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Who Are Your Third Parties?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your accountant or bookkeeper</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>IT support company</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud storage providers (Dropbox, Google Drive)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Your lawyer</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Cleaning company</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Anyone else who has your business data or can access your building</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Simple Risk Check</h2>
                <p>Ask yourself these questions about each company you work with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do they have my customer data?</li>
                    <li>Can they access my computer systems?</li>
                    <li>Do they come into my office?</li>
                    <li>Would my business be in trouble if they got hacked?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you answered yes to any of these, you need to check their security.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What to Ask Them</h2>
                <p>For important suppliers, ask these simple questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Do you have cyber insurance?"</strong> If they say no, that's a red flag.</li>
                    <li><strong>"What happens if you get hacked?"</strong> They should have a plan and promise to tell you immediately.</li>
                    <li><strong>"How do you protect my data?"</strong> They should mention encryption and secure storage.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Who can see my information?"</strong> Fewer people is better.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What to Do Right Now</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Make a list:</strong> Write down every company that has your data or system access</li>
                    <li><strong>Check contracts:</strong> Make sure they promise to tell you about security problems within 24 hours</li>
                    <li><strong>Remove old access:</strong> If you stopped using a service, make sure they deleted your data</li>
                    <li><strong>Use separate accounts:</strong> Never give suppliers your main business login details</li>
                    <li><strong>Check annually:</strong> Once a year, review who has access and remove anyone you don't need</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Real World Example: Accountant Gets Hacked</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>What happened:</strong> A small Sydney business had their financial data stolen when their accounting firm got hacked.</p>
                    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> The accountant didn't have proper security and never told the business about the breach for three weeks.</p>
                    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Now they only work with accountants who have cyber insurance and promise immediate breach notification.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Simple Steps to Start Today</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ Write down everyone who has your business data</li>
                    <li>☐ Email your top 5 suppliers asking if they have cyber insurance</li>
                    <li>☐ Check if old suppliers still have access to your accounts</li>
                    <li>☐ Create separate login accounts for any suppliers who need system access</li>
                    <li>☐ Add "breach notification within 24 hours" to your standard contract terms</li>
                </ul>
