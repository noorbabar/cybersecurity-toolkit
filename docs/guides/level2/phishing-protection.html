            <h1>Complete Phishing Protection Guide</h1>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
                <p><strong>Phishing is when cyber criminals pretend to be someone you trust</strong> to trick you into handing over sensitive information, money, or access to your systems. It's not just emails anymore - attackers use phone calls, text messages, social media, and even in-person tactics.</p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong> Reality:</strong> With AI, criminals can now perfectly mimic voices, write flawless emails, and create convincing fake websites in minutes. The old "look for typos" advice no longer works.</p>
                </div>
                <p><strong>95% of successful cyber attacks start with some form of phishing.</strong> Small businesses are prime targets because they often lack the sophisticated defenses of large corporations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Types of Phishing Attacks</h2>
                <p>Modern phishing comes in many forms. Here are the most common types targeting small businesses:</p>

                <div class="step-container">
                    <h3> Email Phishing (Classic)</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Fake emails pretending to be from banks, suppliers, or services you use.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Your PayPal account is suspended. Click here to reactivate."</p>
                    <p><strong>Red flags:</strong> Urgent language, suspicious sender domains, unexpected requests for information.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step-container">
                    <h3>Vishing (Voice Phishing)</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Phone calls from scammers pretending to be IT support, banks, or government agencies.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "This is Microsoft support. Your computer is infected. Give us remote access to fix it."</p>
                    <p><strong>AI Danger:</strong> Criminals can now clone voices perfectly using just a few seconds of audio from social media.</p>
                    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Never give passwords or remote access over the phone. Hang up and call back on official numbers.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step-container">
                    <h3>Smishing (SMS Phishing)</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Text messages with malicious links or requests for information.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Your package delivery failed. Click here to reschedule: bit.ly/fake-link"</p>
                    <p><strong>Business target:</strong> Fake messages about invoices, deliveries, or urgent business matters.</p>
                    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Don't click links in unexpected texts. Verify through official channels.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step-container">
                    <h3>Spear Phishing</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Highly targeted attacks using personal information about you or your business.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Email to your accountant: "Hi Sarah, I need you to wire $15,000 to our new supplier for the Melbourne project ASAP. - [Your name]"</p>
                    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Uses real names, projects, and relationships found on social media or company websites.</p>
                    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Verify all financial requests through a second communication method.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step-container">
                    <h3>Business Email Compromise (BEC)</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Criminals impersonate executives or suppliers to request money transfers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> "This is [CEO name]. I'm in a confidential deal. Wire $50,000 to this account immediately. Don't discuss with anyone."</p>
                    <p><strong>Target:</strong> Finance teams, accounts payable staff, business owners.</p>
                    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Always verify large payment requests with a phone call using known numbers.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step-container">
                    <h3> Pharming</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Redirecting you to fake websites even when you type the correct web address.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong> Malware on your computer or compromised DNS servers redirect legitimate sites to fake ones.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You type "mybank.com" but get redirected to a fake banking site that steals your login.</p>
                    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Use bookmarks for important sites, check for HTTPS, keep antivirus updated.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step-container">
                    <h3> Social Media Phishing</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Fake messages or posts on LinkedIn, Facebook, or other platforms.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> LinkedIn message: "I saw your business profile. We can help you get a government grant. Click here for details."</p>
                    <p><strong>Business angle:</strong> Often targets business opportunities, networking, or professional services.</p>
                    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Be skeptical of unsolicited business opportunities online.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step-container">
                    <h3> Angler Phishing</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Fake customer service accounts on social media responding to complaints.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You complain about a service on Twitter. A fake support account replies: "DM us your login details to fix this."</p>
                    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Only communicate with verified official accounts. Check for blue verification ticks.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step-container">
                    <h3> Whaling</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Sophisticated attacks specifically targeting senior executives and business owners.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Fake legal subpoena or tax audit notice requiring immediate response and sensitive information.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why dangerous:</strong> Executives have access to the most sensitive information and financial controls.</p>
                    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Extra verification for all legal, tax, or regulatory requests.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Universal Red Flags (All Phishing Types)</h2>
                <p>These warning signs apply whether it's an email, call, text, or social media message:</p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4> Immediate Red Flags</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Urgency/Pressure:</strong> "Act now or face consequences"</li>
                        <li><strong>Fear tactics:</strong> "Your account is compromised/suspended"</li>
                        <li><strong>Too good to be true:</strong> "You've won money" or "Amazing business opportunity"</li>
                        <li><strong>Requests for sensitive info:</strong> Passwords, SSNs, banking details</li>
                        <li><strong>Unusual requests:</strong> Boss asking for gift cards or wire transfers</li>
                        <li><strong>Generic greetings:</strong> "Dear Customer" instead of your name</li>
                        <li><strong>Mismatched information:</strong> Email from CEO but sent from Gmail account</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>The VERIFY Protocol</h2>
                <p>Before responding to any suspicious communication, follow this protocol:</p>

                <div class="step-container">
                    <h3>V - VERIFY the Sender</h3>
                    <p>Check email addresses, phone numbers, and social media accounts carefully. Look for small differences like "amaz0n.com" instead of "amazon.com".</p>
                    
                    <h3>E - EXAMINE the Request</h3>
                    <p>Does this request make sense? Is it normal for this person/company to contact you this way?</p>
                    
                    <h3>R - RESIST Pressure</h3>
                    <p>Legitimate companies rarely demand immediate action. Take time to think and verify.</p>
                    
                    <h3>I - INVESTIGATE Independently</h3>
                    <p>Contact the company/person through official channels you already know (don't use contact info from the suspicious message).</p>
                    
                    <h3>F - FOLLOW UP Safely</h3>
                    <p>If it's legitimate, they'll understand your caution. If it's fake, you've avoided a trap.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Y - YIELD to Caution</h3>
                    <p>When in doubt, don't respond. It's better to miss one legitimate email than fall for one scam.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Real Attack Examples (Learn from Others' Mistakes)</h2>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Example: AI Voice Cloning Attack</h4>
                    <p><strong>What happened:</strong> A Sydney law firm's finance manager received a call from someone who sounded exactly like the senior partner, requesting an urgent $85,000 transfer for a "confidential acquisition."</p>
                    <p><strong>The trick:</strong> Scammers used 3 seconds of audio from the partner's podcast interview to clone his voice with AI.</p>
                    <p><strong>What saved them:</strong> The firm had a policy requiring all transfers over $10,000 to be verified with a second person in the room.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Voice cloning is now easy and cheap. Never authorize large payments based on voice alone.</p>
                </div>


            <div class="section">
                <h2>If Someone Falls for It</h2>
