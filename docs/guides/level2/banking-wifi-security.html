                    <h4>What to do for secure banking:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Never use public WiFi for banking:</strong> Coffee shops, airports, and hotels have unsecured networks where criminals can see your data</li>
                        <li><strong>Always type your bank's web address directly:</strong> Don't click links in emails or texts, type "yourbank.com.au" into your browser</li>
                        <li><strong>Look for the padlock symbol:</strong> Make sure you see "https://" and a lock icon in your browser's address bar</li>
                        <li><strong>Log out completely when finished:</strong> Don't just close the browser, click the "Log Out" button</li>
                        <li><strong>Use your business mobile data instead:</strong> If you must bank while out, use your phone's data connection instead of public WiFi</li>
                        <li><strong>Set up account alerts:</strong> Get text messages or emails for all transactions over $100</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Designate specific computers:</strong> Only do banking from your office computer, not laptops or phones</li>
                        <li><strong>Use a dedicated browser:</strong> Keep one browser just for banking, don't use it for anything else</li>
                        <li><strong>Enable two factor authentication:</strong> Your bank should offer this, we'll cover how to set it up: <a href="mfa-guide.html">read more here</a></li>
                        <li><strong>Check statements daily:</strong> Review your business accounts every morning for unauthorised transactions</li>
                        <li><strong>Use business only accounts:</strong> Never mix personal and business banking on the same devices</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Use WPA3 security:</strong> This is the latest WiFi security standard, check your router settings</li>
                        <li><strong>Create a strong WiFi password:</strong> Use a long, complex password that's different from your other passwords</li>
                        <li><strong>Hide your network name:</strong> Don't broadcast your business name as your WiFi name</li>
                        <li><strong>Set up a guest network:</strong> Give visitors a separate WiFi network that can't access your business systems</li>
                        <li><strong>Change default router passwords:</strong> Your router comes with a default admin password, change it immediately</li>
                        <li><strong>Update router firmware regularly:</strong> Check for updates monthly or enable automatic updates</li>

                <h2>Real World Example: 'Evil Twin' Wi-Fi Scam Targets Travelers</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> In 2024, a Western Australian man was charged after setting up fake "free Wi-Fi" networks at airports in Perth, Melbourne, Adelaide, and on domestic flights. These rogue "evil twin" networks mimicked legitimate Wi-Fi hotspots to trick users into connecting.</p>
                  <p><strong>The trick:</strong> Once connected, unsuspecting passengers were redirected to fake login pages that stole personal information such as email and social media credentials, which were stored for later misuse.</p>
                  <p><strong>What saved them:</strong> Airline staff noticed the suspicious Wi-Fi during a flight, leading to authorities seizing devices from the suspect’s luggage and charging him.</p>

                  <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Always verify public Wi-Fi networks before connecting. Avoid accessing sensitive accounts like online banking over unsecured networks.</p>
