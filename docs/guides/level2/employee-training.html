            <h1>Employee Training</h1>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What is Employee Training?</h2>
                <p>Employee Training teaches your team how to spot and avoid cyber attacks. Your staff are often the first line of defense against criminals trying to break into your business systems.</p>
                <p>Most successful cyber attacks start by tricking employees, not by breaking through technical defenses. Training helps your team become a security asset instead of a security risk.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Why Your Staff Are Targeted</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Easier than hacking:</strong> It's simpler to trick a person than break through firewalls and security software</li>
                    <li><strong>They have access:</strong> Employees already have legitimate access to your systems and data</li>
                    <li><strong>They trust easily:</strong> Staff want to be helpful and may not question requests that seem to come from colleagues or suppliers</li>
                    <li><strong>They make mistakes:</strong> Everyone clicks wrong links, uses weak passwords, or shares information when they shouldn't</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Essential Training Topics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phishing emails:</strong> How to spot fake emails trying to steal passwords or install malware</li>
                    <li><strong>Password security:</strong> Creating strong passwords and never sharing login details</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical security:</strong> Locking computers, securing documents, and controlling building access</li>
                    <li><strong>Social engineering:</strong> Recognizing phone calls and in-person attempts to trick them into giving away information</li>
                    <li><strong>Incident reporting:</strong> Who to tell and what to do when something suspicious happens</li>
                    <li><strong>Safe internet use:</strong> Avoiding dangerous websites and downloads</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Simple Training Methods</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monthly team meetings:</strong> Spend 10 minutes each month discussing a different security topic</li>
                    <li><strong>Email examples:</strong> Forward real phishing emails (safely) to show what to watch for</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple checklists:</strong> Give each employee a desk card with security reminders</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice drills:</strong> Test how staff handle suspicious emails or phone calls</li>
                    <li><strong>Real examples:</strong> Share news stories about local businesses that got attacked</li>
                    <li><strong>Reward good behavior:</strong> Acknowledge staff who report suspicious activity</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What to Teach About Modern Phishing (AI Era)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Perfect spelling means nothing:</strong> AI writes flawless emails now. Don't trust emails just because they're well-written</li>
                    <li><strong>Check the actual email address:</strong> Click on the sender name to see the full email address. Scammers use similar domains like "gmai1.com" instead of "gmail.com"</li>
                    <li><strong>Verify through different channels:</strong> If someone emails asking for money or information, call them on a number you already have saved</li>
                    <li><strong>Be extra suspicious of urgency:</strong> "Wire this money today or we lose the contract" is a classic AI-generated pressure tactic</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch for unusual requests:</strong> If your boss never usually emails you directly about payments, question it</li>
                    <li><strong>Use our verification templates:</strong> We provide scripts for checking suspicious requests</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Real World Example: AI Phishing Nearly Costs $80K</h2>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Case:</strong> A Melbourne law firm received a perfectly written email from their "accountant" requesting urgent payment to a new supplier for court documents.</p>
                    <p><strong>AI tricks used:</strong> Perfect grammar, referenced real case names, used the accountant's email signature, created fake urgency about court deadlines.</p>
                    <p><strong>What saved them:</strong> The office manager used their verification rule: she called the accountant on his mobile to confirm. It was fake.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Even perfect emails need verification. AI makes everything look legitimate now.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Making Training Stick</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep it short:</strong> 10-15 minute sessions work better than long presentations</li>
                    <li><strong>Make it relevant:</strong> Use examples that relate to your specific business and industry</li>
                    <li><strong>Be positive:</strong> Focus on helping staff protect the business rather than threatening punishment</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice regularly:</strong> Monthly reminders work better than annual training sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Lead by example:</strong> Management should follow the same security practices they expect from staff</li>
                    <li><strong>Update content:</strong> Keep training current with new threats and attack methods</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
