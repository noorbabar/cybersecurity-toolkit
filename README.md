## The Problem

60% of small businesses close within 6 months of a cyber attack. Not because solutions don't exist, but because frameworks like NIST are written for enterprise IT teams.

Small business owners need actionable guidance, not 100 page technical documents. That's why I createed Lock Step: to help bridge that gap.

## What It Does

**3-Minute Risk Assessment** → Identifies vulnerabilities, outputs prioritised action plans

**Progressive Learning Guides** → Six skill levels with specific tools, costs, and timelines

**Interactive Phishing Simulator** → Hands on training for spotting real threats

**Production-Ready Templates** → Security policies and incident response plans for small teams

## Tech Stack & Decisions

**Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** → No dependencies, minimal attack surface, works offline

**Static Site Architecture** → No backend vulnerabilities, fast load times, easy deployment

**Mobile-First** → Built from 320px up (43% of small business owners work from mobile)

**Progressive Enhancement** → Works without JavaScript, better with it

## Development Status

Started as a project for a course I completed at unsw: COMP6441 (Security Engineering). However I'm continuing development because the problem is real and the gap is massive.

Currently refining UI/UX, implementing additional tools (password analyzer, vendor risk evaluator), and testing with actual small business owners.

**Key Challenge:** Balancing technical accuracy with accessibility without losing critical information.

## Key Learnings

Examples beat theory. Progressive disclosure prevents overwhelm. Small business owners are time constrained and need quick wins. Shipped beats perfect.

## What's Next

**Short-term:** Complete interactive tools, user testing, mobile optimisation

**Medium-term:** Industry specific guidance, progress tracking, threat intelligence feed

**Long-term:** Community features, measurement tools, certification program

## Why It Matters

Every small business deserves enterprise level protection. Lock Step proves complex security concepts can be accessible without sacrificing accuracy.
