# Lock Step
*Cybersecurity Toolkit for Small Businesses*

## Inspiration
60% of small businesses close within 6 months of a cyber attack, yet they face the same sophisticated threats as major corporations without the resources to defend themselves. 

Existing cybersecurity frameworks like NIST and CIS Controls are powerful but written for enterprise IT teams. Small business owners don't have time for 100-page technical documents. Lock Step bridges this gap by democratizing cybersecurity - translating complex frameworks into practical guidance that real business owners can actually use.

## What it does
Lock Step transforms intimidating cybersecurity concepts into digestible, actionable resources:

- **Progressive Learning Guides**: 6 skill levels from beginner to security-aware business owner
- **Interactive Risk Assessment**: 3-minute questionnaire with prioritized action plans
- **Ready-to-Use Templates**: Security policies, incident response plans, and compliance checklists
- **Interactive Phishing Simulator**: Hands-on training for spotting modern phishing attempts
- **Practical Implementation**: Every recommendation includes specific tools, costs, and step-by-step instructions

##  How I built it
Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for strategic reasons:

**Architecture Choices:**
- **Static Site Design**: No backend required, loads fast, inherently secure
- **No Dependencies**: Minimizes attack surface, no supply chain vulnerabilities
- **Mobile-First CSS**: Built from 320px up for maximum accessibility
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript, enhanced with it

##  Challenges I Faced

**Technical:**
- CSS styling and layout implementation
- Frontend framework decision (React vs vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)
- Cross-device compatibility and responsive design
- UI/UX design technical constraints

**Content & User Experience:**
- Balancing technical accuracy with accessibility
- Defining appropriate scope ("not enough" vs "overwhelming")
- Language calibration for different technical literacy levels
- Testing with time-constrained users
- Designing resources for diverse industries
- Time management and perfectionism

## Key Accomplishments
- Successfully translated enterprise frameworks without losing critical information
- Created meaningful interactivity without complexity
- Built practical implementation focus with exact tools and step-by-step instructions
- Developed logical progression for complete beginners through clear learning paths
- Used real Australian business case studies and current threats

## What I Learned
- **Content Strategy**: Examples beat theory, progressive disclosure prevents overwhelm, every technical term needs practical context
- **User Psychology**: Small business owners are time-constrained, trust comes through honesty, empowerment beats fear
- **Development**: Perfectionism is the enemy, scope definition prevents feature creep, constant user perspective improves everything

##  What's Next

**Immediate (3 months):**
- User testing with real small business owners
- Content refinement based on feedback
- Complete interactive suite (password tester, social engineering simulator)
- Mobile optimization

**Medium-term (6 months):**
- Industry-specific guidance
- Community features

**Long-term (12+ months):**
- Measurement tools for tracking security improvement
- Certification program

**Ultimate Goal:** Transform cybersecurity from an intimidating technical challenge into an achievable business competency - because every small business deserves enterprise-level protection without enterprise-level complexity.
